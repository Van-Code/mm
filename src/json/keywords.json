there's nobody so happy as a baby in a hiking carrier with a yummy snack. granola bars, jerky and trail mix are classic picks, and fruits like apples, bananas and oranges go the distance, too. just remember to take any trash with you, including apple cores and orange peels. if you want to make something, try our long haul trail mix. you can also make and freeze energy balls. tuck frozen balls in your backpack and they'll be the perfect consistency when hunger strikes. 8. wear smart shoes tennis shoes with good traction are fine for starting out. if you like hiking enough to keep doing it, then invest in hiking boots or shoes. boots will give you better ankle stability if you're carrying a heavy pack and are necessary for rougher terrain. for shorter hikes, lower-cut, lighter-weight trail running shoes are often more comfortable. 9. explore more once you feel comfortable on local trails and have built up some endurance, it's time to branch out. you may even start planning vacations around hiking adventures! state and national parks offer amazing experiences you truly can't get anywhere else. exploring yellowstone national park can feel like visiting another planet, for example. and the beautiful blue ridge mountains in north carolina offer breathtaking views. 10. have fun! you're in for a good time — especially if you start with short hikes on well-marked trails and make sure to go when there's still plenty of daylight left. in most neighborhood and city park trails, you might be surprised by the variety of wildlife you see, like deer, squirrels, chipmunks and birds. you might even run across animals you've never seen in your area before, like a striking pileated woodpecker with that iconic bright red head crest.

probiotics are live microorganisms that are part of your normal gut bacteria. we often think of bacteria as harmful or unwanted, but bacteria are actually important for our bodies to work properly when digesting food and performing other functions. why are probiotics important? think of your body like an ecosystem. everything needs to remain in balance for optimal health. probiotics are not intended to prevent, treat or cure any disease; however, they may be beneficial for restoring bacteria balance after yeast infections and diarrhea. in our pharmacy, we are often asked about using probiotics during a course of antibiotics. studies have shown that probiotics reduce the frequency of antibiotic-associated diarrhea, but make sure to separate the probiotic and antibiotic doses each day. probiotic supplements are available in tablets, capsules, powders, gummies and liquid extracts. what are the most common probiotic strains and what does each one do? probiotics are commonly sold over the counter, but not all species available are part of the normal human gut flora (the microorganisms that live in the intestines). the beneficial effects from one probiotic strain cannot be generalized to every strain. lactobacillus and bifidobacterium are the most common strains, easily recognizable in over-the-counter products. the precise way probiotics work is still being studied, but it is thought that lactobacillus and bifidobacterium produce compounds that limit growth of bad” bacteria. what are the best ways to get probiotics? probiotics are readily available in foods like yogurt and as over-the-counter products and dietary supplements. what about prebiotics? what do they do? probiotics contain live microorganisms that, when ingested, are directly added to your gut flora. prebiotics are different because they are plant fibers that stimulate growth of bacteria in your gut. fruits and vegetables commonly contain prebiotics. taking a prebiotic may make your probiotic more effective, but it isn’t required for the probiotic to work. eat (or drink) your probiotics heating any of these foods kills both harmful and good” bacteria. so if you want the full probiotic benefits, enjoy them in their raw form: yogurt kombucha sauerkraut kimchi kefir tempeh miso 7 delicious yogurt toppers "},{"id":"Article1908401","html":"   --> share w when it comes to winter produce, vivid colors and tart flavors aren't typically in season. enter grapefruit. these citrusy globes can brighten a variety of meals, whether sliced and added to salads or broiled with sugar on top. what a way to start the day! a delicious cluster grapefruits originated in barbados and are hybrids — an accidental cross between oranges and pomelos. unlike other citrus fruits, grapefruits grow in clusters, hence the 'grape' part of the name. there are three main colors — red, pink and white — all of which have distinct flavors. be sure to select a grapefruit that is firm all the way around, as well as plump and heavy with smooth skin. the sweetness scale red, the most common, are the sweetest, best eaten plain or broiled in the oven. pink are mildly sweet, great for juicing. white are very tart, with pale yellow skin and light-colored pulp, a delicious addition to salads. if pink or white versions aren't available for a recipe, a red grapefruit will work. storage solutions countertop: keep unpeeled and unbagged at room temperature if eating within a few days. refrigerator: store whole in the crisper drawer or sliced in an airtight container. freezer: freeze sections on parchment paper, then transfer to a freezer bag. broiled grapefruit the high heat caramelizes the sugary topping and highlights the natural sweetness of the grapefruit. it also tenderizes the pulp, making it easy to spoon right from the peel. get recipe zero hunger | zero waste tip scrape inside of peels clean, removing as much white pith as possible (a spoon works great), then cut into thin strips. place in medium saucepan and cover with water. bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat and simmer 10 minutes. drain and set aside. in same saucepan, bring 1 cup sugar and &frac12; cup water to a boil over high heat. place peels in sugar mixture, reduce heat and simmer 10&#8209;15 minutes, stirring frequently. drain peels, roll in granulated sugar, if desired, and place on wire rack to dry, 24&#8209;48 hours. store in an airtight container.

the subtle sweetness. and they're a well-matched side to whatever you're serving, from chicken to steak or even eggs. so what exactly makes them so tasty? it's a little thing called caramelization. caramelization is a chemical reaction that brings out the natural sweetness in vegetables. in their raw state, of course, most vegetables don't taste sweet at all. that's because their starchy molecules are effectively disguised by their relatively large size — our taste buds simply don't recognize these starches as sweet until they're broken down into much smaller molecules. that's where roasting works its magic. at higher heats and in the absence of water, particular enzymes within the vegetables are released to break down those molecules and unleash the sweetness. you can visually tell when it's happened because dark brown coloring develops in spots and the veggies become a bit shriveled. those visual cues also let you know that hundreds of new aromatic compounds have formed, creating a flavor profile that's sweet, nutty, toasty and totally craveable. it's a must-try technique for almost any vegetable, particularly the fall bounty of root vegetables and squashes at peak season right now. even if there's a vegetable you think you don't really like — brussels sprouts or cauliflower, perhaps — give roasting a try. you might be delightfully surprised. garlicky melting

roasting. they're done when they've developed some brown spots and are fork-tender. you can also try our recipes featured here, some of which call for slightly higher heats to accommodate different types of vegetables and meats together. roasted vegetable combos amounts are very forgiving, so there's no need to be concerned about exact measurements. as a general rule, you should start with a baking sheet filled rim-to-rim with vegetables in a single layer. add 1–2 tablespoons total of dried herbs and spices. limit liquid ingredients like honey or balsamic vinegar to two tablespoons or

'they are typically transmitted by the respiratory fluid of an infected person,' tara explains. strep throat symptoms so how do you know if a sore throat is bacterial? 'things to look for include fever, sudden and severe sore throat, tender or swollen lymph nodes on the neck, and red or white filled spots in the mouth and back of throat with painful swallowing,' tara says. other symptoms include headache, nausea, vomiting, stomach pain and a rash that has a sandpaper feel. with any of these symptoms, it might be time to visit the clinic. the diagnosis 'for strep throat, we look for the distinctive symptoms, but other clues as well,' tara says. for example, it's more common in winter and early spring, and among patients 5–15 years of age, those in contact with someone with strep throat in the last five days or patients with a prior history of strep throat. additionally, a test called a centor scoring tool helps determine if it's strep throat caused by gas, which is typically treated with antibiotics. for viral cold or flu infections, symptoms can run the gamut — fever or feeling feverish, chills, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, muscle or body aches, headaches and fatigue — and they typically resolve without treatment. because the cold and flu have similar symptoms, it can be difficult to differentiate them based on symptoms alone, so a rapid influenza diagnostic test (ridt) can confirm the diagnosis of the flu, if necessary. soothe the soreness regardless of the cause, there's hope for relief! 'try ice chips, sore throat sprays, frozen pops or lozenges. gargling with saltwater or drinking warm beverages may help as well,' tara says. 'in addition, plenty of rest and hydration are recommended. over-the-counter medications, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen may also help, but avoid using aspirin for children 12 years old or younger.' as for antibiotics, only sore throats caused by gas will benefit from them. while strep throat can also go away on its own after a few days, antibiotics can help reduce the length and prevent spread and complications, especially in children. just remember to take all prescribed antibiotics and avoid skipping doses, even if you're feeling better before they're gone. prevention tips keep these tips in mind to help avoid and prevent spreading of colds, flu and strep throat this season: don't share glassware or silverware with others. avoid close contact with infected people.* get a yearly flu vaccination (available in our pharmacy). cover your mouth and nose with a tissue, upper sleeve or elbow when coughing or sneezing. toss tissues in the trash immediately after use. wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. avoid touching eyes, nose and mouth to prevent the spread of germs. clean and disinfect surfaces and objects that may be contaminated. discard and replace toothbrushes of anyone taking antiobiotics 24 hours after starting treatment. *if diagnosed with strep throat or the flu, avoid work, school or daycare until fever is gone and antibiotics or antivirals have been taken for at least 24 hours. call your doctor if symptoms do not get better after 48–72 hours, regardless of whether antibiotics are being taken.

'wear full-length clothing to avoid contact with plants,' suggests dr. watkins. 'barrier creams such as bentoquatam can also be applied prior to exposure to prevent the development of dermatitis.' however, dr. watkins does caution, 'it must be reapplied every 4 hours and leaves a clay residue that may be undesirable to some.' 0\"> 0\"> stinging nettles identification: the stinging nettle is a long, tall stalk with hairs on its stem. it also features drooping, catkin flowers and oval, toothed leaves. interaction and reaction: when touched, the spicules on the plant (also known as the hairs) cause a stinging or burning sensation and can manifest as raised bumps or hives. while it doesn't truly sting, it certainly feels that way. treatment: 'allow affected areas to dry and then gently wash with soap and water,' instructs dr. watkins. surprisingly, it's easier to remove spicules when dry. 'avoid heat or warm compresses as this will cause further irritation.' a combination of topical, anti-inflammatory creams and oral antihistamines can provide relief from the stinging sensation. 0\" > poison ivy identification: the telltale sign of poison ivy? a cluster of three leaves with pointed tips. just remember, if it has leaves of three, let it be! depending on the season, this plant can be reddish, green or even yellow-orange. interaction and reaction: poison ivy secretes an oil called urushiol, which causes the itchy rash associated with this pesky plant. contrary to popular belief, it actually takes up to 24 hours for a reaction to surface. however, direct contact isn't the only way to experience 'a brush' with urushiol. burning poison ivy also releases gas that can cause lung irritation if inhaled. treatment: 'the first step to getting rid of the rash is washing the affected areas with soap and water and scrubbing under nails to remove any resin,' says dr. watkins. also wash any clothes that may have been contaminated. did your dog join you on the hike? use gloves and give pets a thorough scrub, too. the one thing you shouldn't do? scratch. 'scratching affected areas could break the skin and cause an infection,' dr. watkins cautions. not to mention, it could reintroduce the oil to other places. 0\" > poison oak identification: unlike poison ivy, poison oak doesn't always grow in clusters of three. instead, look for scalloped (wavy) leaves that have rounded tips (much like its namesake the oak leaf). the color changes with the seasons: bright green in spring, yellow-green or pink in summer and yellow-brown in fall. interaction and reaction: poison oak also contains the irritating urushiol oil. 'the rash usually develops 4–96 hours after exposure,' says dr. watkins. 'the rash or associated blister are not contagious.' wash affected areas and any clothing that may be contaminated—and don't scratch. treatment: 'topical treatments can be helpful to reduce the irritation and itch,' explains dr. watkins. 'products containing menthol and phenol (calamine lotion) and astringents such as aluminum acetate can help.' hydrocortisone (a topical steroid cream) is also beneficial. a cool soak with an oatmeal-based bath product can help relieve itching. or, try placing cool compresses on the affected areas for 15–30-minute intervals throughout the day. if untreated, the rash should resolve in approximately 3 weeks. if it persists or continues spreading to other areas, it should be evaluated by a medical professional.

put your expired medications into the trash and dispose immediately. do not flush expired medications down the toilet unless the label clearly states it is the recommended and safe method of disposal. if you want to know more, states or counties usually have information about disposing medications on their websites, as well as information on recycling the plastic bottles. just remember to remove the prescription labels first. the drug enforcement administration (dea) also has two annual drug takeback days, and it makes sure all medications get safely incinerated. visit takebackday.dea.gov to find a collection site near you. i'm always surprised at the amount of expired medications people keep on hand — sometimes years past their expiration dates! okay, the expired medications are gone and we're getting ready for summer. what should we keep on hand?

most people keep medications in the bathroom cabinets. this isn't good for two reasons: it's highly accessible to kids, and the constant fluctuations in heat and humidity actually damage the medications. instead, keep them in a hall closet or on a higher shelf outside the bathroom. it should be retrievable but not accessible. any final advice?

that means the shafts of hair absorb more moisture — causing unmanageable, puffy locks. first and foremost, make sure your hair is moisturized. treat yourself to an overnight serum or a deep-conditioning treatment each month. and, always finish your look with anti-humidity hairspray. this will lock hair down and stop it from expanding. avoid creams and gels; they tend to get stickier when exposed to moist air. dull and dry give your hair a break every once in a while. shampoo may wash away daily grime and hair products, but it also strips natural oils. try an every-other-day method for shampooing, or try a few days of using only conditioner. if you can't get away with skipping the shower, take a look at the products you're using. some mousses, gels and creams have sulfates and phthalates, which can exacerbate dryness in the summer months. chlorine-discolored always wash hair after swimming to remove chlorine. if you forget or let a day go by, try a shampoo designed to remove chlorine or a diy clarifier: i.e. mix 1 tablespoon baking soda or apple cider vinegar with 2 tablespoons water. scrub it throughout hair and rinse well. follow up with a deep conditioner. keeping your hair and head nourished is key. dead skin cell buildup can affect the growth of hair follicles. flat look for protein-enriching products to help breathe new life into limp locks. fine hair doesn't absorb moisture, instead moisture settles on top of it weighing it down. when looking to combat flat hair, take it easy on the products, which can quickly add unwanted weight. finally, consider scaling back your washing routine. overwashing can make your hair overproduce sebum. and avoid vigorous scrubbing, which also encourages oil production.

'music learning that starts early in life has a profound impact on the developing brain's ability to process speech and learn language,' says dr. zhao. 'it helps the brain to listen to speech in a noisy environment, to discriminate speech sounds in native and non-native languages, and so on. in our own research, we found that this effect can be observed as early as 9 months old.' so what does that mean in terms of milestones? babies who have increased speech and language skills may begin talking earlier than the average of 12 months old. or by 2 years old, they may begin talking in complete sentences and have a vocabulary of closer to 1,000 words as opposed to the typical 300 at that age. but that's not all. beyond increasing speech and language abilities, music can also help improve social-emotional development and enhance cognitive skills. a toddler with good social-emotional abilities, for example, will be better able to identify — and deal with — strong emotions. and that might translate to fewer tantrums! you might also be able to reason with them a little earlier and carry on meaningful conversations. while these are serious benefits, the key to exposing babies to music is to keep things light and make it fun — for yourself and little ones. here are a few ideas to get you started: create your own instruments having instruments around the house gives kiddos a hands-on chance to make music. wooden spoons on a cookie sheet, a handful of beans in a coffee can, some rubber bands on an old shoebox, and you have your very own three-piece band! turn on some tunes at mealtimes try playing some classical music at mealtimes or mixing in some smooth jazz to go along with that afternoon snack. any music you enjoy works well! make up your own songs turn humdrum daily chores such as sorting laundry or setting the table into little songs. not only can these silly songs liven up a dull task, but they can help little ones master new skills. tap it out helping babies clap along with music is an easy way to demonstrate the rhythmic connection between what they're hearing and feeling. expose kids to live music from coffee shop jazz trios and street performers to mommy-and-me music classes, there are lots of low-key ways to take in live shows without breaking the bank. check with your local library, mall or theater for fun, kid-friendly performances.

'[antihistamines] are effective in reducing itching, sneezing and runny nose, but have little effect on nasal congestion,' explains olivia. and though many are marketed as providing instant relief, olivia cautions, 'patients should start taking antihistamines at least once a week before symptoms typically appear — or as soon as possible before you expect to be exposed to allergens.' that means you should be proactive as opposed to reactive. not all antihistamines are created equal. 'the leading brands and their generic counterparts have different active ingredients but the same mechanism of action, and therefore belong to the same class of medications,' olivia says. 'there is no single ideal over-the-counter medication.' that's why it's best to consult a pharmacist or doctor. symptom squasher here is a quick guide for choosing the right medicine. for nasal congestion start with an oral or nasal decongestant and assess in 3–4 days. unlike antihistamines, decongestants target the fluid in the lining of your nose to relieve swollen nasal passages. for itchy throat, runny nose or sneezing start with an oral antihistamine and assess in 3–4 days. if you have side effects, switch to another. for headaches some headaches have an allergic basis, but most do not. if 't’s a sinus headache' it’s typically localized over the sinus area. oral or nasal decongestants may help relieve some pressure. for sinusitis untreated allergies may lead to sinusitis in some people. if over-the-counter medications are not improving symptoms or are impairing daily activities due to side effects, see your physician. busting allergy myths some people think the body builds up a tolerance to over-the-counter medications. this isn't quite the case. 'evidence suggests that drug tolerance does not occur with allergy medication, but people still report medications stop working for them over time,' she explains. 'it's more likely that your sensitivity to an allergen has increased rather than the medication stopped working.' olivia notes that while you should see relief within 3–4 days, sometimes it can take 2–4 weeks. and remember, allergies can't be cured. 'instead, our goal is to improve symptoms and your quality of life.' that being said, allergy medications work best when taken consistently, as directed, and before exposure to allergens. patients should start taking antihistamines at least once a week before symptoms typically appear. allergies or common cold? 'allergies are your immune system reacting to a substance,' says olivia. 'cold infections are caused by a virus.' typically, allergies occur soon after exposure to the allergen and symptoms will likely be the same each day. colds may have several symptoms and clear up in 7–10 days whereas allergies may persist longer. allergies or sinusitis? sinusitis is an infection or inflammation of the sinuses (the hollow spaces in the bones around the nose). the symptoms often include discolored nasal drainage, persistence over a 10-day period and worsening after appearing to get better.

'the ideal ratio is two to three eggs per one liquid cup of cream,' says chef alissa. the egg helps add firmness to the filling, and the cream or milk helps keep the texture silky smooth. chef alissa offers a simple tip for combating the dreaded soggy crust. 'the best way to prevent this is to parbake the crust,' she says. parbake means baking for a short amount of time before adding the filling. the cheese added to the quiche can also act as a moisture barrier. the ideal ratio is two to three eggs per one liquid cup of cream. 'after you parbake the crust, make sure it is cool, then line the bottom with an even layer of cheese before filling with custard,' says chef alissa. 'this will help keep the crust flaky and crispy.' as for fillings, chef alissa advises adding as much as you like. 'just make sure to leave about a quarter to a half inch of crust around the rim!' if you're planning to create a quiche for a springtime get-together, it's ok to keep the rest of the menu fairly simple — for example, fresh fruit works well. chef alissa likes to pair quiche with mixed greens and a light vinaigrette.

if yes, fantastic! if not, now is the perfect time to start. either way, make sure you check your city's policy. and keep your recyclable items clean. paper products for every ton of paper recycled, 3.3 cubic yards of landfill space is saved. so how is it recycled? long story (slightly) short, it's shredded by pulpers and added to a mixture of paper, water and chemicals that's heated until the pieces of paper break down into fibers. that mixture is pressed, cleaned and heated to form rolls, used to make new products. every time a paper product is recycled, the length of its fiber gets shorter. so the higher the grade, the longer the fiber. lower grade papers like newspapers have already been recycled numerous times. once it's been recycled around seven times, the fibers become too short to make new paper using the traditional process. virgin fibers must be added for strength. what kinds of paper can't be recycled? anything considered 'contaminated' is thrown out. one of the worst culprits? pizza boxes! paper products with grease or other food remnants are diverted to a landfill. the grease doesn't mix with the water needed to break the paper down. if oily paper gets added to a mix of other papers, the whole bunch is tainted. so it's best to compost used pizza boxes, paper plates, napkins and paper towels. plastics the general rule for plastics is actually the opposite of paper. the higher the grade, the harder to recycle. many cities can only recycle low-grade plastics labeled 1 and 2. soft plastics like bags, plastic wrapping and yogurt containers are actually labeled as 5 and will likely be rejected. they're harder to break down and are often repurposed for heavier duty, mechanical items that don't have as much of a demand. if you do want to recycle bags, look for special programs —including collection bins at our stores. as for other plastics, the general rule is you can recycle any container with a neck smaller than its body. just be sure to remove the shrink-wrap labels. they tend to block the optical sorting technology and cause inaccurate sorting. but what about the caps? again, it's best to check your local recycling program first as they will specify how or if they want bottle caps collected. if collected, it's best to keep them on the bottle so they don't get lodged into the machinery during sorting. the clear clamshells used for produce and other food items are also known as polyethylene terephthalate (1pet) thermoform. although the clamshells say 1, it's not the same as a 1 bottle. thermoform has to be heated at a different temperature, and like the other plastic resins, must be recycled separately. again, check with your local recycling programs to see what's accepted. aluminum and glass aluminum is aluminum in most curbside recycling programs — no weight or size limits. that means cans, foil, pie tins and trays are good to go. glass, on the other hand, should be given a once over. in general, you should only recycle glass containers like bottles and jars. heavier glassware like cookware, drinking glasses and windows have different melt temperatures and should not be mixed with the usual suspects. e-waste did you know that 92% of most cellphones can be used to manufacture new equipment? many of our stores actually have kiosks that recycle phones for cash! please check your store for availability. it's also important to look up collection centers and programs for computers and household items like batteries, which contain hazardous metals such as mercury, cadmium and lead. key takeaways don't sneak contaminated or greasy products in your bin. compost used paper products like napkins, plates and paper towels. remove labels, stickers and adhesives from all recyclables. if you're unsure, first check your city's recycling rules. if you still aren't sure, throw it out, so you don't soil the rest of the recyclables or contribute to broken equipment. the lower the grade plastic, the easier it is to recycle. avoid 'scrunchable' and soft plastics, such as cling wrap and packaging. avoid recycling heavily dyed paper, wrapping paper and shredded paper. avoid recycling ceramics, light bulbs and glass cookware. to help our shoppers help the earth, we've committed to eliminating all plastic bags by 2025, which will divert 123 million pounds of garbage annually sent to landfills. learn more "},{"id":"Article1901341","html":"   --> share d did you know green goddess dressing has theatrical roots?

'look for ticks on lower extremities and on the backs of legs and scalp for yourself and kids,' advises dr. watkins. 'check for ticks on pets by gently rubbing over their coats to find attached or non-attached ticks and remove immediately.' keep in mind that ticks can be very tiny — no more than 1/8 inch as adults and as small as 1⁄32 inch in the nymph stage. also check places like underarms, waistline and the groin area. as an extra precaution, throw clothes in the dryer on high heat or wash them in hot water to kill any ticks that may be hanging out in the folds of fabric. a hot shower can keep ticks from attaching and offer a good opportunity to check yourself from head to toe. treat pets. make sure to stay up-to-date with regular flea and tick treatments for dogs and cats who go outside. the benefits are twofold: your animals stay well, and they don't pass ticks along to others! if you experience a rash or a fever and suspect you've been bitten by a tick, see your doctor. spotlight on lyme disease now more than ever, it's important to take preventive measures against tick bites. one reason? the deer tick that used to be prevalent only in certain areas of the country has now been found in all 50 states. 'overall warmer winters are allowing the ticks to survive longer and essentially extend their reproductive cycle,' explains dr. watkins. 'as the ‘lyme season' is extended, the ticks are able to expand their geography and continue to thrive.' removing a tick if you do find a tick on yourself or a pet, stay calm. 'remove the tick using tweezers, grasping the tick as close as you can to the skin and pulling gently in an upward motion,' says dr. watkins. 'the goal is to remove the tick in one piece, without leaving any part of the tick in the wound where bacteria tend to linger.' then clean the area well. ticks removed within 36 hours of attaching won't have an opportunity to transmit lyme disease, which is why it's smart to do a check shortly after coming in from outside.

every wing fanatic claims their own technique is the way to go. but, there's no single path to amazing wings. we're going to demystify the pros and cons of some popular methods so you can decide the best fit for your game day. the wings you can buy frozen bags of pre-sectioned drumettes and flats (or drumettes only). these take 1-2 days in the fridge to fully thaw. sprinkle the raw wings with salt before cooking. if you're interested in the anatomy, chicken wings have three parts: the drumette (the meaty, thick part at the base), the flat (the less meaty center section) and the tip (the small, pointy end). when prepping wings, cut through their two joints. discard the tips or save them for stock. saucing and serving it's a controversial stance, but we like to toss wings with a moderate amount of sauce immediately before serving. this helps the wings stay crispy, plus gets sauce into all the nooks and crannies. you can also serve additional sauce tableside. celery sticks are a valuable palate cleanser, as well as a fine vehicle for the cooling powers of blue cheese or ranch dressing. and remember to offer lots of napkins or hand wipes! the methods wings have a high ratio of skin to meat. the key to can't-eat-just-one wings is getting the skin crispy so it contrasts with the moist interior meat. some methods yield crispier wings than others, but require attention. if you don't want to miss out on the game, other approaches still give you great wings. 1. oven-roasting this is the simplest way to cook a lot of wings at once with minimal hands-on time. for the crunchiest skin possible, let 2&frac12;–3 pounds of wings air-dry, uncovered, on a wire rack in the fridge for 1–2 days. to cook, preheat oven to 450°f. spread wings on a rimmed baking sheet and cook until well browned, about 30 minutes per side, flipping halfway through. 2. frying messy and best done in small batches, frying truly gets you the crispiest, most succulent wings. to flash-fry, heat at least 1&frac12; inches vegetable oil in a deep pot or skillet to 375°f. fry batches of 8–10 wings for about 15 minutes. work ahead (and get crunchier wings!) by par-frying 3 pounds of wings at 225°f for 20 minutes, then letting them rest on a rack for 1 hour (or refrigerate for up to 3 days). fry a second time in batches in 400°f oil until browned, about 10 minutes. 3. grilling grilled wings benefit from a charred, smoky flavor. the downside?

'infection occurs when germs enter the body, increase in number and then cause a negative reaction in the body,' explains halie g. there are three main things that have to align for an infection to occur: a source where the germs live, a susceptible person (a way for the germs to enter) and then transmission (the way germs are moved). sources so, just how long can germs live on a surface? 'it depends on the type of bacteria or virus, what kind of surface they are on and what the surrounding environment is like,' explains halie. there are actually four kinds of germs: bacteria (one-celled microorganisms that can reproduce outside the body), viruses (need a host to reproduce, must be inside the living cell), fungi (multi-celled, plant-like) and protozoa (one-celled organisms that live in moist areas and spread disease through water). 'most viruses that cause colds only survive on hands for a short amount of time,' halie says. 'some only last for a few minutes; however, 40% of rhinoviruses, a common cold-causing virus, are still infectious on hands after one hour.' if someone at your house is ill, disinfect hard surfaces frequently. flu viruses, on the other hand, some flu viruses can survive on hard surfaces for 24 hours. infectious flu viruses can survive on tissues for only 15 minutes. however, all flu viruses can survive as droplets in the air for several hours — longer in lower temperatures. bacterial or viral germs that typically cause stomach bugs survive on hard surfaces or fabrics from 1 to 4 hours. some viral germs can last even longer like norovirus and c. difficile. norovirus can survive for days or weeks on hard surfaces. in one study, c. difficile was shown to survive for five months! if someone at your house is ill, disinfect hard surfaces frequently. susceptibility to avoid getting sick, halie's top tip is simple: wash your hands the right way. 'properly washing your hands should take you about as long as it takes to sing ‘happy birthday' twice,' says halie. 'always use soap and water if you can — or hand sanitizer with 60% alcohol content if needed.' hand sanitizer can reduce the number of germs on your hands, but may fail to remove stuck on chemicals, pesticides and heavy metals. aside from frequent handwashing, avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth and get your seasonal flu vaccine. you can also keep your immune system strong and healthy by eating well, exercising regularly and getting adequate sleep. transmission to help reduce spreading germs, stay home if you feel ill and be proactive with your cleaning measures. since many germs thrive —and even multiply — in damp situations, make sure to keep things like clothes clean and dry. when it comes to disinfectant, carefully read the label to see if it mentions cold and flu viruses. 'remember not to follow a disinfectant wipe with a dry paper towel in an effort to dry the surface more quickly,' halie cautions.'that leftover residue from the wipe continues disinfecting as you walk away and will dry on its own.' looking for a greener option?

'beef was too expensive for working class irish people in the mid-1800s,' says mairéad. 'instead, they chose pork, which was far easier on the wallet.' so how did irish-americans end up celebrating with corned beef instead? well, irish immigrants arriving in new york in the 1840s found that pork was far more expensive than beef! enter corned beef and cabbage. another popular treat that's not actually irish: irish potato candy. 'don't be fooled by the name,' says mairéad. 'these candies have a coconut cream interior and are rolled in cinnamon to give the appearance of a small potato, but they aren't irish.' in fact, they originated in philadelphia — possibly first created by an irish immigrant, but there's still no one person credited for inventing this candy. apricot glazed corned beef true to the americanized version of this irish dish, it's made with beef instead of pork. get recipe leprechauns & shamrocks in the united states, mischievous leprechauns are as much a symbol of st. patrick's day as shamrocks and green beer. but these festive figures weren't always a part of authentic irish celebrations.

'his green beverage was created by adding a drop of a powdered iron solution used to whiten clothes, which we now know to be poisonous. modern, safer food dyes have replaced dr. curtin's formula for creating green beer on st. patrick's day, and the tradition has survived in the united states to this very day.' green beer still hasn't taken off in ireland. 'guinness stout remains one of the most popular beers. it's a dark black porter with a creamy top,' she explains. 'dark hues make it difficult to dye green.' leprechauns have only recently become part of our st. patricks day celebrations in ireland. even four-leaf clovers aren't quite as irish as they seem. in ireland, it's the three-leaf clover that represents st. patrick, as he used it to explain the concept of the holy trinity. 'the adoption of four-leaf clovers for irish celebrations developed in irish-american folklore,' says mairéad.

'look for ticks on lower extremities and on the backs of legs and scalp for yourself and kids,' advises dr. watkins. 'check for ticks on pets by gently rubbing over their coats to find attached or non-attached ticks and remove immediately.' keep in mind that ticks can be very tiny — no more than 1/8 inch as adults and as small as 1⁄32 inch in the nymph stage. also check places like underarms, waistline and the groin area. as an extra precaution, throw clothes in the dryer on high heat or wash them in hot water to kill any ticks that may be hanging out in the folds of fabric. a hot shower can keep ticks from attaching and offer a good opportunity to check yourself from head to toe. treat pets. make sure to stay up-to-date with regular flea and tick treatments for dogs and cats who go outside. the benefits are twofold: your animals stay well, and they don't pass ticks along to others! if you experience a rash or a fever and suspect you've been bitten by a tick, see your doctor. spotlight on lyme disease now more than ever, it's important to take preventive measures against tick bites. one reason? the deer tick that used to be prevalent only in certain areas of the country has now been found in all 50 states. 'overall warmer winters are allowing the ticks to survive longer and essentially extend their reproductive cycle,' explains dr. watkins. 'as the ‘lyme season' is extended, the ticks are able to expand their geography and continue to thrive.' removing a tick if you do find a tick on yourself or a pet, stay calm. 'remove the tick using tweezers, grasping the tick as close as you can to the skin and pulling gently in an upward motion,' says dr. watkins. 'the goal is to remove the tick in one piece, without leaving any part of the tick in the wound where bacteria tend to linger.' then clean the area well. ticks removed within 36 hours of attaching won't have an opportunity to transmit lyme disease, which is why it's smart to do a check shortly after coming in from outside.

companies have been working to roll out the revamped labels ever since. this year, you should be seeing it on most products. one of our dietitians, ashley martinez, explains the changes. q: why are nutrition labels being updated? a: the label has not been updated in more than 20 years! a lot of research has evolved that will be reflected on the new label. for example, we have found that products with added sugars should be limited, the type of fat americans consume is more important than the amount coming from calories, and the average serving size should be reported more accurately. q: what are some of the biggest changes? a: you will see updates to the design and appearance. calories will be listed in bold, added sugars will be called out, and the nutrients identified on the bottom half of the label will be changed to reflect the nutrients in which americans are typically deficient — vitamin d, potassium, iron and calcium. listing vitamins a and c will no longer be required. another important change you'll see is updated serving sizes of specific foods and/or products. the changes better reflect the appropriate (or actual) serving sizes. for example, the nutrition label of individually-sized sports drinks will be reflective of the entire bottle as opposed to half. also, ice cream will now be labeled as two-thirds cup per serving as opposed to one-half cup. q: how will the updated labels help customers make better choices? a: all in all, the changes to the label are positive. it is important for americans to see how much added sugar is in a product, the amount of nutrients it contains and how to properly understand the label with the appropriate serving sizes. instead of the label being misleading, it is more informative. q: what should consumers keep in mind when reading the new labels? a: continue to reference the serving size as a first callout. many consumers make the mistake of looking at the calories, sodium, etc. without referencing the serving size. now that added sugars will appear on the label, this will be easier to understand. however, it's beneficial to always check the ingredient lists to fully identify what you are consuming.

but later changed his name to patricius (or patrick) when he became a priest. born around 387 a.d. in roman britain, patrick was kidnapped around the age of sixteen and taken to ireland as a slave. upon his escape some six years later, he felt called to the priesthood. patrick eventually returned to ireland and is credited with converting thousands to christianity before his death around 461 a.d. early celebrations the first celebrations in honor of st. patrick were quiet family affairs. the holiday falls during the christian season of lent and was observed by the irish as a religious holiday. families would attend church and then gather for a feast. over time, though, as the legend of st. patrick grew and irish immigrants made their way to distant lands, the holiday took on a life of its own. parades and (green) pints now, st. patrick’s day is celebrated all over the world with parties and parades, including the annual new york city st. patrick’s day parade. the parade, which first occurred in 1762 when irish soldiers serving in the english military marched through new york city, is now one of the world’s oldest civilian parades. it’s also the largest parade in the u.s., with more than 150,000 participants and millions of spectators. chicago also has a well-known parade where the famed chicago river gets a green makeover for the holiday. the tradition started in 1962, when city pollution-control workers used green vegetable dye to turn the river green. green beer is another relatively recent addition to st. paddy’s festivities. while it might be hard to imagine a st. paddy’s celebration without pints, irish laws actually forbid pubs from opening on march 17 until the 1970s. a return to tradition despite all the ways st. patrick’s day celebrations have evolved over the years, for many it means a return to tradition. clodagh mckenna, an irish chef and cookbook author, sees st. patrick’s day as a chance to celebrate her heritage. our family tradition is to go to mass together in the morning and then cook something really traditional for lunch and go to a pub where they play traditional irish music,” she says. food remains a centerpiece of an authentic celebration. in ireland, everything revolves around the kitchen table. whether it’s a cup of tea with tea brack or a big sunday lunch for all the family, food is at the heart of day to day life, as well as our celebrations.” when it comes to preparing for the feast of st. patrick, don’t expect to find corned beef and cabbage on the table. though the dish is a st. paddy’s day staple in the u.s.,

and 7-year-old really woke me up to the fact that if i didn't do something, i wouldn't be around to see my kids have kids. and that really bothered me. so, i joined a program that teaches me how to change my habits one at a time. the first two habits that i broke were eating three meals a day and eating just because. i learned that eating six small meals per day every 2-3 hours and eating within 30 minutes after getting up in the mornings gives your metabolism a jump-start and helps keep your body full of energy. i also learned the value of drinking more water. it not only makes you feel fuller, but it flushes away all the bad things that your body needs to get rid of. 41 pounds later, i am loving life again. i have energy to keep up with my kids and love trying new recipes. i've

'making them more visual, fun and relatable to everyday life makes them easier to understand.' danica recommends drawing and shading shapes to help cement the basics. if the weather's nice, this is a fun activity to do outside with sidewalk chalk. just draw a few shapes on the ground, and then ask your child to divide them up. play with dominoes or plastic building bricks dominoes are a simple, yet playful way to reinforce what numerators (the top numbers) and denominators (the bottom numbers) mean. 'many young kids get confused and think, for example, that the fraction one third (&frac13;) is bigger than one half (&frac12;) because 3 is a larger number than 2,' says danica. 'the first step to helping kids understand fractions is to explain that the bottom is how many parts there are total, and the top number is how many of those parts we actually have.' you can use dominoes for a fraction face-off, with each person drawing a random tile to see who has the biggest fraction. (just make sure you turn it so the bigger number is on the bottom.) for more competitive fun, you can each draw five tiles and then line up by increasing value. first one done wins! danica also recommends plastic building bricks to make math time feel more like playtime. 'just count the little dots with your child, and you can show different fractions,' she says. 'for example, use two four-dot plastic building brick pieces to cover a single eight-dot piece, and you can see one is half the size of the other.' head to the kitchen making your child's favorite dish is another easy way to learn about fractions in a hands-on context. 'measuring cups are a fantastic real-world example of fractions that kids can see and understand,' says danica. 'you can compare the amounts and see the difference right in front of you!' with older children, you can even try doubling a recipe — or cutting one in half — and figure out together how the fractions will change. 'i did this with my son for our big dinner last christmas,' says danica. 'i made two apple pies, and i had him figure out on his own what the doubled measurements would work out to be. it was fun for both of us!' you can even bake a few fraction lessons into your next pizza. for instance, let kids put on the toppings — maybe half has pepperoni, a quarter has green peppers, a third has extra cheese. ask them to help slice the pizza, as well. simple ways to prevent summer learning loss bridget heos, former teacher, social worker and author of several books, including summer brain quest studies show that many students return to school each fall academically behind where they were just a few months prior. bridget heos, a former teacher and social worker-turned-author, shares how to keep children on pace. exercise the brain 'the brain needs exercise to stay in shape just like the body,' says bridget. 'summer brain work may include reading, learning a new skill, being creative, visiting new places and doing workbooks.' make learning organic meal times are especially ripe with hands-on learning opportunities, according to bridget. from reading recipes to measuring ingredients to combining and mixing, your sous chef will cover english, math and science. reinforce learned concepts 'when children are learning a new concept, it's helpful to review what they learned each day,' advises bridget.

if yes, fantastic! if not, now is the perfect time to start. either way, make sure you check your city's policy. and keep your recyclable items clean. paper products for every ton of paper recycled, 3.3 cubic yards of landfill space is saved. so how is it recycled? long story (slightly) short, it's shredded by pulpers and added to a mixture of paper, water and chemicals that's heated until the pieces of paper break down into fibers. that mixture is pressed, cleaned and heated to form rolls, used to make new products. every time a paper product is recycled, the length of its fiber gets shorter. so the higher the grade, the longer the fiber. lower grade papers like newspapers have already been recycled numerous times. once it's been recycled around seven times, the fibers become too short to make new paper using the traditional process. virgin fibers must be added for strength. what kinds of paper can't be recycled? anything considered 'contaminated' is thrown out. one of the worst culprits? pizza boxes! paper products with grease or other food remnants are diverted to a landfill. the grease doesn't mix with the water needed to break the paper down. if oily paper gets added to a mix of other papers, the whole bunch is tainted. so it's best to compost used pizza boxes, paper plates, napkins and paper towels. plastics the general rule for plastics is actually the opposite of paper. the higher the grade, the harder to recycle. many cities can only recycle low-grade plastics labeled 1 and 2. soft plastics like bags, plastic wrapping and yogurt containers are actually labeled as 5 and will likely be rejected. they're harder to break down and are often repurposed for heavier duty, mechanical items that don't have as much of a demand. if you do want to recycle bags, look for special programs —including collection bins at our stores. as for other plastics, the general rule is you can recycle any container with a neck smaller than its body. just be sure to remove the shrink-wrap labels. they tend to block the optical sorting technology and cause inaccurate sorting. but what about the caps? again, it's best to check your local recycling program first as they will specify how or if they want bottle caps collected. if collected, it's best to keep them on the bottle so they don't get lodged into the machinery during sorting. the clear clamshells used for produce and other food items are also known as polyethylene terephthalate (1pet) thermoform. although the clamshells say 1, it's not the same as a 1 bottle. thermoform has to be heated at a different temperature, and like the other plastic resins, must be recycled separately. again, check with your local recycling programs to see what's accepted. aluminum and glass aluminum is aluminum in most curbside recycling programs — no weight or size limits. that means cans, foil, pie tins and trays are good to go. glass, on the other hand, should be given a once over. in general, you should only recycle glass containers like bottles and jars. heavier glassware like cookware, drinking glasses and windows have different melt temperatures and should not be mixed with the usual suspects. e-waste did you know that 92% of most cellphones can be used to manufacture new equipment? many of our stores actually have kiosks that recycle phones for cash! please check your store for availability. it's also important to look up collection centers and programs for computers and household items like batteries, which contain hazardous metals such as mercury, cadmium and lead. key takeaways don't sneak contaminated or greasy products in your bin. compost used paper products like napkins, plates and paper towels. remove labels, stickers and adhesives from all recyclables. if you're unsure, first check your city's recycling rules. if you still aren't sure, throw it out, so you don't soil the rest of the recyclables or contribute to broken equipment. the lower the grade plastic, the easier it is to recycle. avoid 'scrunchable' and soft plastics, such as cling wrap and packaging. avoid recycling heavily dyed paper, wrapping paper and shredded paper. avoid recycling ceramics, light bulbs and glass cookware. to help our shoppers help the earth, we've committed to eliminating all plastic bags by 2025, which will divert 123 million pounds of garbage annually sent to landfills. learn more "},{"id":"Article1901221","html":"   --> share e ever dreamed of rolling a perfect omelet?

'instead of high-calorie foods with low nutritional value, encourage kids to eat foods that are low in processed sugar and high in fiber that can help improve gut health and assist the immune system capabilities,' says sarah. and don't underestimate the value of a good night's sleep. 'receiving adequate sleep allows our bodies to recharge so that our immune system is rested to fight off illness, including flu and cold viruses,' says sarah.

'babies can form memories before they're born, and one thing they remember is the muffled sound of their mother's voice and the quieter sounds of other voices,' says dr. swingley. 'the sound is muffled enough that they're probably learning about the overall rhythm and intonation of the language, but not really the words.' marking the milestones right from birth, little ones are primed for language development. in the first few months, babies start making those oh-so-sweet cooing sounds and develop different cries for different needs. by six months, babies even understand a few words. what you may not realize, though, is that during this period babies are also learning how the consonants and vowels of their language sound. 'for the first couple of years, infants' understanding of language is much greater than their ability to speak,' says dr. swingley. 'for instance, infants typically start to babble in a way that sounds like real syllables by 8–10 months. a 12-month-old would find it strange if you spoke in sentences with the words all in the wrong order. by 18 months, they typically know many more words and have a more precise understanding of what words mean.' listening for those first words around the 12-month mark, start listening for those first words. and don't be surprised if a little one says ‘mommy' or ‘daddy' first. as it turns out, these are common first words — and not just in english. 'across languages, the words for ‘mommy' and ‘daddy' are often syllables that are easy for children to say — or to say accidentally,' says dr. swingley. 'but lots of children have really idiosyncratic first words. according to my parents, my first word was ‘jet.'' talking to your baby there's a lot you can do to encourage a baby's language development, starting with simple conversations. and, while it's easy to get distracted by those chubby baby cheeks, remember that your baby knows much more than he or she can show. 'you don't have to ‘talk down' to your baby,' says dr. swingley. 'of course, a baby isn't necessarily interested in grown-up topics, but you don't have to babble to your baby, and you don't have to overdo the cutesy baby talk. babies like a loving tone, but you can combine that with real sentences.

ashley says: unfortunately, the coconut butter cannot be substituted. can i make my own coconut butter? ashley says: yes, homemade coconut butter is easy to make and very affordable. to make it, simply add a bag of unsweetened shredded coconut (the softer and moister the coconut feels, the better) to a food processor and process for 8–10 minutes, stopping to scrape down the sides as needed. you’ll be left with a smooth, liquid coconut butter that’s perfect for this recipe. can i make this vegan?

ashley says: this could work as a full-size pie, but you’d likely need to double the recipe to fill a regular size pan. also, instead of a classic pie dish, i’d use a springform pan (lined with parchment paper) to make it easier to slice and serve.

'look for individually packaged chicken breasts, frozen fish fillets and individual potatoes for baking, as well as a few larger packaged items, like salad greens, to eat at several meals.' greens can be enjoyed as salads, stirred into soups or even sautéed in a little olive oil. freeze your leftovers cooking big meals can still make sense when you're dining on your own. if you're craving homemade vegetable soup, cook a big pot. eat your fill, and then freeze the rest in individual serving sizes you can thaw as needed for a quick, home-cooked meal. get creative with weekly themes it can be easy to get into a recipe rut. keep things fresh with theme weeks. maybe it's mexican one week and mediterranean the next. this also helps cut back on leftover ingredients because you can reuse the same items from recipe to recipe. veg out fresh veggies are an easy and healthy way to add color and flavor to any meal. carve out a little time on sunday evenings to cook a big batch of veggies, and then add them to your dinners throughout the week. spread a mix of your favorite vegetables on a sheet pan, add some olive oil and seasonings, and cook for 35 minutes at 425°f. get fancy with favorites try a new take on a favorite meal — like mac and cheese, for example. step it up each week with a new addition — smoked mozzarella one week, bacon the next, lobster the week after that.

tons of innovative new products make it easier than ever to bring healthier trends to the table, whether your goal is to enjoy more plants or eat less sugar. here's a taste of six of the biggest healthy living trends you'll likely be hearing about all year long. 1. plant power when it comes to health food trends, 'plant-based' is everywhere. foods, drinks and even nonedible items like body care products are all jumping on the bandwagon. unlike the labels of vegan or vegetarian, plant-based is an inclusive umbrella broad enough to cover those who eat meat and dairy alongside their veggies. over half of people in the u.s. are enjoying more plant-based foods and beverages. globally, those numbers are even higher. motivation to incorporate more plant-based fare is being fueled by everything from an interest in general health to concern for animals and the environment. maybe you have one of the most popular plant-based items in your fridge right now &mdash; almond milk, coconut milk or oat milk, anyone? and that's just naming a few of the nondairy milks available. or you might be a fan of those veggie burgers, sausages and nuggets with appealing meaty textures. oh yes, and what about nondairy yogurts and cheeses? the list goes on! shop plant-based products southwestern turkey and white bean burgers rolled oats and smashed white beans add plant-based power to these tender, tasty patties. get recipe 2. specialized diets the 'right' way to eat is different for everyone — maybe that's why there are so many different diets. here are three of the most popular. paleo was first introduced in the 1970s and became widely popular beginning in 2014. it's modeled on the diet of early (paleolithic) humans. why? the thinking goes that the human body hasn't evolved to handle the processed foods so prevalent today. paleo practitioners eat fruits, nuts, seeds, vegetables, meats (especially grass-fed) and fish. no grains, potatoes, legumes or highly processed foods. most recently, pegan (part paleo, part vegan) has evolved. in fact, it made pinterest's top 100 trends for 2019 — up 337% in searches! shop paleo-friendly products next up is the keto diet. vaguely reminiscent of the atkins approach, keto meals are high in fat and extremely low in carbohydrates. typically, carbs are limited to around 50 grams a day. the body is then forced to get its energy from fat rather than carbs, thus entering a state of fat-burning ketosis. results come fairly quickly for many, but some nutritional experts say it might be hard to keep up long term. shop keto-friendly products finally, there's intermittent fasting. there are two approaches to this dietary lifestyle. one approach is to eat very few calories on certain days and normal amounts on others. the second approach is to only eat during certain hours of the day. for most, that means fewer overall calories consumed, resulting in weight loss. it also shows promise in improving insulin sensitivity and boosting brain function.* *always consult your doctor before starting a new diet. 3. the brain-gut connection made up of approximately 100 trillion bacteria, your gut microbiome weighs in at between 3–5 pounds &mdash; about the size of your brain. that's an apt comparison since new research links gut health to brain illnesses, including depression and anxiety. while research is still in the early stages, it seems safe to conclude that we should keep our gut microbiomes happy and healthy. 2020 is sure to bring all kinds of products purported to help, including probiotic and prebiotic supplements, snacks, yogurts and drinks. just be smart and talk to your doctor before starting a new regimen or stopping any medications. 7 delicious yogurt toppers 4. the low/no-sugar movement are we finally taming our collective sweet tooth? many are trying, at least! according to a recent gallup poll, more than half of adults are trying to avoid sugar. instead, people are turning to foods that are free of sugar or replace refined sugar with alternative sweeteners like maple syrup, dates, stevia and monk fruit. this trend is fueled by an interest in general health, plus specific concerns around rising rates of obesity and diabetes. in addition, some of the most popular diet trends dictate limiting sugar intake. for example, paleo and keto diets keep carbohydrate intake low. you'll notice this trend throughout our stores, with no-sugar-added claims popping up on everything from dressings to pasta sauces. even manufacturers of traditionally sweet items are taking steps to dial back the sugar content, in some cases using a blend of cane sugar with other sweeteners. ginger-spiced beet and oat milk latte a cooked beet creates a lovely pink color in this caffeine-free, refined-sugar-free, dairy-free drink made with creamy oat milk. get recipe 5. cbd beauty products first things first: these beauty products won’t get you high!

'for example, making pizza crust demonstrates that yeast is a living organism that pumps out enough carbon dioxide gas to puff up dough,' says liz. 'when they freeze homemade ice cream or sorbet, kids learn how crystals form in a sugar syrup. making popovers illustrates what happens when steam pressure is trapped in stretchy dough, with delicious results. even making a simple vinaigrette is a science lesson in emulsions. the list goes on and on.' mastering math in addition to playing the role of scientists, kids can also sharpen their math skills. whether they're measuring spices or slicing a homemade pizza into quarters or eighths, they'll have lots of opportunities to add up the fun. math is essential to baking, because the proportions of ingredients have a dramatic effect on the outcome 'math is essential to baking, because the proportions of ingredients have a dramatic effect on the outcome,' says liz.

'as you cook with kids, ask them questions,' says liz. 'for example, remind young children that the fruits and vegetables we eat are plants, and that even baking flour is made from plant seeds. ask them what plants need in order to grow (sunlight, water, air and nutrients). see whether older kids can explain what photosynthesis is. they may surprise you with what they know! if they don't know the answer, ask them to look it up and explain it to you. 'don't be afraid of big words! they're fun, and they make kids feel smart. look up the scientific names of the kitchen chemicals in recipes. for example, baking soda is sodium bicarbonate. vinegar is watered-down acetic acid. when baking soda and an acid like vinegar are mixed together, the chemical reaction between them forms carbon dioxide bubbles.' embracing trial and error there's no pressure for perfection when you're whipping up these dishes. instead, encourage creative problem solving, innovation and even more experimentation. 'through trial and error in the kitchen, kids learn that failure is the best teacher, that mistakes sometimes yield surprisingly good results, and that they can always try something else,' says liz. 'for example, what happens when they substitute one ingredient for another? how does replacing butter with margarine or shortening change the texture of chocolate chip cookies? do extra-large eggs give the same result as large eggs?' whatever yummy creation you end up with on the dinner table, kids are sure to remember that science can be fun…and delicious. the science behind the food: wheat protein is the secret to making chewy, delicious pizza crust. when particles of wheat flour are added to water and then stirred, the proteins form a unique elastic complex called gluten. gluten can absorb large amounts of water, and kneading allows gluten complexes to come into contact with more gluten to form superlong elastic structures. these gluten strands make pizza chewy and are exceptional at trapping bubbles. you'll often see big bubbles in a well-made pizza crust. sugar gets in the way of gluten and is sometimes added to dough to create a more tender crust. tips and hints: add 1 teaspoon yeast instead of two for less puffy dough. prebake crusts for 5 minutes before adding super-soggy ingredients, like lots of fresh tomatoes or extra sauce. excerpted from kitchen science lab for kids: edible edition, by liz lee heinecke, courtesy of the quarto group pizza dough a little bit of math plus a little bit of science adds up to the perfect base for homemade pizza. get recipe 0\"> 1. knead the dough. 2. allow dough to rise. 3. flatten and stretch the dough. 4. add toppings and bake in the oven or on the grill. 5. dig in! 6. share (if you want to!) photo credit: amber procaccini "},{"id":"Article1908361","html":"   --> share meet our expert dr. leo galland,md,internal medicine, new york city i if you suffer from heartburn symptoms, you probably assume the cause is too much stomach acid. but the truth is more complicated. as people age, the digestive tract muscles weaken and stomach acid levels naturally decrease. this means that heartburn might actually be caused by too little stomach acid (a condition known as hypochlorhydria) or by other issues related to muscle weakness. while prescription medicines and over-the-counter antacids can offer short-term relief from heartburn symptoms, dr. leo galland, a noted author, speaker and practitioner, offers some simple lifestyle changes that may help. understand the cause the first step to better managing heartburn is understanding the cause. after all, heartburn is a symptom that something, somewhere, isn’t working quite as it should. and, for millions of americans, heartburn is becoming increasingly burdensome. in fact, more than 60 million americans experience heartburn at least once a month, while more than 15 million experience symptoms on a daily basis, according to the american college of gastroenterology. what’s more, notes dr. galland, is that heartburn medicines are the most commonly used medications in the u.s. today. so, what’s really behind this acidic epidemic? heartburn isn’t caused by excess stomach acid,” says dr. galland. it’s caused by the poor regulation of flow in the esophagus and weakness of the lower esophageal sphincter (les valve) between the esophagus and stomach.” the les valve is supposed to let food pass from the esophagus into the stomach and then close. tight. but a weakened les valve can open when it’s not supposed to. this lets stomach acid travel from the stomach back into the esophagus, which then causes heartburn. it doesn’t take much acid to cause discomfort, either. just a little will do it. identify contributing factors figuring out why this happens in the first place is harder to pinpoint, but dr. galland says there are a number of factors at play. many factors contribute to this disorder, including being overweight, taking medication that weakens the les valve (several types of drugs and hormones do this, including progesterone and calcium blockers), and eating when stressed or rushed. heartburn can also be a symptom of a food allergy or celiac disease.” heartburn can also be a symptom of a food allergy or celiac disease. practice portion control you can reduce heartburn symptoms by opting for smaller, more frequent meals instead of eating three larger meals a day. dr. galland also recommends portion control. this is because when you overeat, your stomach becomes distended, or swollen. this can keep the les valve from closing properly, which lets food and stomach acids back up into the esophagus. chew your food you may remember your mom telling you to 'slow down and chew food' when you were younger. it turns out she was onto something! chewing food into smaller bits before swallowing reduces stress on the esophagus and helps the stomach better metabolize food. as you chew, saliva that contains essential digestive enzymes is released to help improve the digestive process. eat smart watch for trigger foods, and eliminate them from your diet. for instance, dr. galland says highly acidic foods such as tomatoes and citrus juices, as well as chocolate, spicy foods, raw onions, coffee and alcohol have all been shown to increase heartburn symptoms. also keep in mind that a diet high in fatty foods can weaken the les valve. consider cutting back on cream sauces, full-fat dairy products, fried foods and fatty cuts of meat. instead, opt for egg whites, oatmeal, greek yogurt, non-citrus fruits such as bananas and apples, lean meats and seafood, ginger, and vegetables such as leafy greens. instead, opt for egg whites, oatmeal, greek yogurt, non-citrus fruits such as bananas and apples, lean meats and seafood, ginger, and vegetables such as leafy greens. look into supplements a number of different supplements have been shown to reduce heartburn symptoms. to help strengthen the les valve, dr. galland recommends a combination of calcium citrate and melatonin. 'try chewable calcium citrate or drinking a calcium citrate drink (but not calcium pills) after each meal and some melatonin at bedtime. but be careful with melatonin — it can be sedating.' if heartburn is specifically caused by low stomach acid, supplemental betaine hydrochloride (hci) may help restore stomach acid levels. always talk to your doctor before adding any supplements to your diet. talk to your doctor if lifestyle changes don't provide relief, consider talking to your doctor about what underlying issues might be causing heartburn and what treatment options might work best for you. remember, too, that some medicines can actually cause heartburn. if you're currently taking medicines for inflammation, high blood pressure, arthritis or other issues, ask your doctor if heartburn could be a side effect.

'each month we chose a park and theme and invited everyone to bring a dish,' say the authors. 'the picnics were so much fun and so gorgeous, that we decided to write the book.' scout your spot when picnicking in a big group, marnie, andrea and jen like to send one person ahead to secure the most picturesque location, drop a map pin, and text it to the rest of the group. that way, everyone can park strategically. think like a caterer rather than completing your dish before you arrive at the picnic, plan to complete some steps at the last minute.

'showcase the main part of the dish,' alissa suggests. debbie adds, 'allow for negative space on the plate; don't fill the plate to its edges or overcrowd it.' that can make for an unappealing presentation. plate in odd numbers 'using odd numbers of food items creates a visual appeal that is attractive to people,' says chris. debbie agrees, using the example of a perfectly cooked steak. 'even the finest filet mignon is going to look clunky if just paired with a baked potato. either add a third element, like asparagus spears, or bring life to the filet by partially slicing it and allowing some juices to flow.' embrace variety variety is the spice of life, and it's also important for a visually appealing plate! 'vary the color, texture and size of the elements,' debbie advises. alissa says, 'create color contrasts and build height to create visual interest. layered dishes in particular play to nearly all the senses, from sight, taste and aroma to the sound of the textures when you bite into them.' choose the right plate think of your meal's plate like you would the canvas for an art project: you want both to be perfect starting points for your creations. 'the color and shape of a plate can really make a difference,' chris says. 'the color of the plate should complement the food items being served on it. unique shapes are always good for capturing people's attention.' allow for negative space on the plate. a perfect final touch a perfect finishing touch can really pull a meal together — but it's important to garnish with purpose. 'keep garnishes simple and relatable to the recipe itself,' suggests debbie. 'this might be a casual sprinkling of fresh herbs or a pop of color from a drip or drizzle of sauce. fresh berries or small herb sprigs are natural additions to dessert presentations.' need some examples? 'if you're eating carnitas tacos, fresh-chopped cilantro adds brightness not only in color, but also in flavor,' says alissa. 'if it's an asparagus soup, a swirl of greek yogurt or sour cream is a great, creamy finish.' know your lighting when you pull off that photo-worthy meal, it's only natural to take a shot with your phone before you take that first bite! 'if you'd like to photograph your restaurant-perfect plate, it's important to use shadows and contrast to give dimension to food,' says debbie. 'there are two things to avoid — lighting from all directions or lighting from overhead. these will make the food look flat and dull.' ready to get cooking? we've included three recipes to help you get started creating beautiful food. very vibrant veggie salad this side dish boasts texture, bright flavors and lots of colorful hues. get recipe springtime lemon bars add a few drops of yellow food coloring to the egg mixture if you want to achieve a bright, sunshiny hue. get recipe spice-rubbed pork tenderloin this savory main dish packs some heat. get recipe what's your trick to dressing up ordinary dishes? we asked, you answered!

it's a question worth considering, especially when you account for the upfront and ongoing costs. if you just want them to be able to contact you in case of emergencies, there are plenty of options, such as basic flip phones and two-way calling watches. consider maturity level consider whether a child is ready for difficult conversations about body image, cyberbullying and inappropriate material. if not, then perhaps they aren't ready for a smartphone, observes brooke. 'spend time with your child talking about and explaining why it's so important to use a smartphone safely, appropriately and moderately,' she says, noting that it's important not to shy away from the tough topics. evaluate risks and rewards the risks are many and well documented. for instance, smartphone usage can contribute to low self-esteem, depression, isolation and poor grades, according to dr. freed. but rewards exist, too, such as increased learning opportunities and exposure to a global community. for janell, who travels for work, smartphones have allowed her to stay connected and involved with her children's lives. start slow if you decide a kiddo might be ready for a smartphone, test the waters with a short, well-monitored trial period. 'start slowly,' says brooke. 'observe how your child handles the privilege. if, after the trial period, you determine it was too soon, then it's okay to take it back or restrict some of the apps and capabilities of the smartphone.' janell agrees, stressing the need for strong parental involvement at each step. 'it's not so much the device, but the user,' she says. 'parent engagement, communication and the adult/child connection are the most important parts of parenting the tech. how is the user supported? what are the expectations? how do we learn from mistakes? how can we try again? i think our tech parenting needs to look and feel like our parenting in all the other spaces.' crafting your own contract parent-kid contracts can help a child better understand the responsibilities, expectations and boundaries that come along with smartphone ownership. as a mother of five, janell burley hofmann has been customizing smartphone contracts since her oldest son turned 13 in 2012. here, she shares a few tips to help you start your own. be flexible your contract is a living document. as a child ages and/or circumstances change, be ready to update it. 'initially when my son was first learning and adapting to having his own device, the rules in the contract were really helpful to give him expectations,' janell says. 'it was really about meeting him where he was as a beginner. we changed and adapted the rules over time, so they grew with him.' emphasize values while it's important to create a contract that complements a child's age and maturity level, there are other factors to consider. janell, who says her family's 'smartphone age' is about 13 years old, recommends building a contract that also reflects and promotes your family values. 'the contracts we make have to be curated to each child as an individual, but the expectations for character don't change based on age,' she says. 'how the kids are engaging with others and treating people, remembering the internet is public space, being mindful of the type of content that's being shared, and representing who they are as people (instead of personas) — these are high value in our home.' enforce the rules consistently when it comes to creating a contract, janell recommends a return to the basics: a tech curfew: create a hard stop for smartphone usage, and make sure children understand the importance of honoring this expectation. taking tech to bed isn't a good idea, so consider an early turn-in time for smartphones and other gadgets. tech-free times: establish consistency around device-free times, such as meals or family time. example of smartphone ground rules janell burley hofmann shared the contract she created for her son. it has provided inspiration for other parents looking to set guidelines for tech usage. view contract is there a right time to let a kid have his/her own smartphone? we asked, you answered!

as it turns out, looks matter during mealtime. a pretty plate can make a picky eater more likely to try something new, and it can even make the food taste better. luckily, presenting a plate with appetite appeal doesn't have to be hard. our three industry experts reveal their tips and tricks to restaurant-perfect plating. keep things simple as the saying goes, less is more. so resist the urge to keep serving until the plate is totally filled. 'showcase the main part of the dish,' alissa suggests. debbie adds, 'allow for negative space on the plate; don't fill the plate to its edges or overcrowd it.' that can make for an unappealing presentation. plate in odd numbers 'using odd numbers of food items creates a visual appeal that is attractive to people,' says chris. debbie agrees, using the example of a perfectly cooked steak. 'even the finest filet mignon is going to look clunky if just paired with a baked potato. either add a third element, like asparagus spears, or bring life to the filet by partially slicing it and allowing some juices to flow.' embrace variety variety is the spice of life, and it's also important for a visually appealing plate! 'vary the color, texture and size of the elements,' debbie advises. alissa says, 'create color contrasts and build height to create visual interest. layered dishes in particular play to nearly all the senses, from sight, taste and aroma to the sound of the textures when you bite into them.' choose the right plate think of your meal's plate like you would the canvas for an art project: you want both to be perfect starting points for your creations. 'the color and shape of a plate can really make a difference,' chris says. 'the color of the plate should complement the food items being served on it. unique shapes are always good for capturing people's attention.' allow for negative space on the plate. a perfect final touch a perfect finishing touch can really pull a meal together — but it's important to garnish with purpose. 'keep garnishes simple and relatable to the recipe itself,' suggests debbie. 'this might be a casual sprinkling of fresh herbs or a pop of color from a drip or drizzle of sauce. fresh berries or small herb sprigs are natural additions to dessert presentations.' need some examples? 'if you're eating carnitas tacos, fresh-chopped cilantro adds brightness not only in color, but also in flavor,' says alissa. 'if it's an asparagus soup, a swirl of greek yogurt or sour cream is a great, creamy finish.' know your lighting when you pull off that photo-worthy meal, it's only natural to take a shot with your phone before you take that first bite! 'if you'd like to photograph your restaurant-perfect plate, it's important to use shadows and contrast to give dimension to food,' says debbie.

'never cut it under that,' he says. 'or it will start curling up on the grill.' all you really need is salt and pepper. prep makes perfect once you've chosen a cut, it's all a matter of prep. for almost any steak, it comes down to the same techniques. however, leaner meats (mostly the end meats like round and chuck) do better when marinated before grilling — it helps them retain moisture during cooking. first, allow the meat to come to room temperature before throwing it on the grill. don't go straight from fridge to grates. this allows for more even cooking. then, preheat the grill and get it as hot as possible. if you don't let the grill heat up, the steak will end up steaming instead of searing. blotting the steak will also wick away the excess moisture and prevent it from instantly charring. it also ensures the outside of a steak will develop just the right amount of crunch. finally, season it and give the spices some time to settle into the steak. as for a perfect seasoning, will considers himself a purist. 'all you really need is salt and pepper,' he says. grilling like a pro 'do not overturn your steak; one flip is enough,' will cautions. this interferes with the searing process and can result in an undercooked, over-charred steak. and, be sure to sear it quickly in the open flame, then move it to a cooler part of the grill. so how do you tell when it's done? use a meat thermometer. 'for a medium rare steak, the temperature should read 145°f; for a medium steak, it should read 160°f; and for well done, 170°f.' but the real key here is letting the steak rest, explains will. 'remove the steak from the grill when it's 5–10 degrees away from the level of doneness you want and cover it for about 10 minutes,' he explains. 'as it's resting, it will continue to cook to the correct temperature.' a cut above 0\"> click below to learn more about the unique characteristics of each cut. ribeye will's top pick! more internal fat means more flavor. also a great steak to use for your first grilled steak.
