In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run serve`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open the url displayed in your terminal to view it in the browser.<br/>
The page will reload if you make edits.<br />

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles Vue in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified. We limit the bundle chunk to 2 because we load the bundle<br/>
in a content delivery service allowing us to push changes to production without a release.
